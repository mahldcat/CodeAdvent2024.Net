# Purpose
Advent of Code 2024:  https://adventofcode.com/2024

These are my solutions to the daily problems (implemented in .Net)

# TODOs
- [ ] Some solutions are not exactly "elegant" (and may be brute force)
- [ ] Naming conventions are sort of all over the place and need to be tamed
- [ ] Convert the Driver code into a Host/Builder/Service architecture
- [ ] Figure out something better than passing the oAuth token in than a raw token--secure cache this?
