# Project Layout
- InputFetch is some boiler plate code that is used to fetch the data from the AOC's endpoint
- Each day's code should be located in AdventDayXXX,
  - I usually try to put the actual logic in two different Code files (Part A and Part B)
  - Other files are generally to parse the data from InputFetch ```List<string>```
